Written for Google as an example of a memory game

Game consists of a 4x4 grid of boxes.  Each box contains a number. Most numbers have a pair, but not all.
If you click on a box, the number is revealed.  Then, click on a second box that you either remember is the pair to the number in the first box, or click on any box to see what is there to remember.
If both boxes' numbers you clicked on match, then you've remembered a pair, and the pair will remain visible.
Repeat this for all pairs you can find.
When and if there are no remaining pairs to find, you will be notified and you can restart the game.
